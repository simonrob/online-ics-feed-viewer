# Online ICS feed viewer
[Online demo](https://simonrob.github.io/online-ics-feed-viewer/)

_Note: this repository contains a very minor update simply to make events display in the local timezone, a popup with event details and a tiny bit of readme formatting. All other aspects are essentially identical to the [original](https://larrybolt.github.io/online-ics-feed-viewer/)._

You can use this tool to either view quickly the contents of an ICS file, or an online feed, or to make a public ICS feed or local file viewable through a URL.


## Why
I can't believe this doesn't exist... I just want this, nothing more. I just don't want to download / import to view something online.

Time it took to make, aka combine two [existing](https://fullcalendar.io/) [javascript](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js) libraries: 2h.

Result: something super useful if you need it. If you need feature-x or it doesn't works, just open an [issue](https://github.com/larrybolt/online-ics-feed-viewer/issues).
